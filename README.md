# opentelemetry-collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation of how to receive, process and export telemetry data. It removes the need to run, operate, and maintain multiple agents/collectors. This works with improved scalability and supports open source observability data formats (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, Fluent Bit, etc.) sending to one or more open source or commercial back-ends. The local Collector agent is the default location to which instrumentation libraries export their telemetry data.
